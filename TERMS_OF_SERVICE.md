# Terms of Service for the Loops Application

**Last Updated:** October 7, 2025

Welcome to Loops. By using our application, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). Please read them carefully.

## 1. Description of Service

Loops is a personal safety application designed to allow users to quickly and easily notify a pre-selected group of emergency contacts ("Safety Circle") when they feel they are in distress. The service uses a combination of push notifications, direct data calls, and email to transmit your SOS alert, which includes your name and location.

## 2. Critical Disclaimer: Not a 911 Replacement

**Loops is not a replacement for 911, 112, or any other official emergency services.**

This application is intended to supplement, not replace, traditional emergency services. It should be used to alert your personal network of friends and family. In the event of a genuine, life-threatening emergency, you should always contact your local emergency services (e.g., by dialing 911) as your first course of action.

The effectiveness of Loops depends on many factors outside of our control, including your device's network connectivity, battery level, location services availability, and the availability and responsiveness of your designated contacts. We cannot guarantee that an alert will be sent or received in every situation.

## 3. User Responsibilities

You are responsible for:

*   **Maintaining Your Safety Circle:** Keeping your list of emergency contacts up-to-date.
*   **Granting Permissions:** Ensuring the application has the necessary permissions (Location, Notifications) to function correctly.
*   **Appropriate Use:** Using the service responsibly and only for genuine personal safety concerns. Triggering false alarms can desensitize your contacts and may be considered misuse of the service.
*   **Account Security:** Keeping your account credentials secure. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.

## 4. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the creators and maintainers of Loops shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of life, injury, or property damage arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the service. You use this service at your own risk.

## 5. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your access to the service at any time, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including if you breach these Terms.

## 6. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the service provider is based, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

## 7. Changes to These Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any significant changes. By continuing to use the service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
